    <h2>What is a Stack?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a
      collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, which
      adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most
      recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which
      elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last
      in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top
      without modifying the stack.[1] The name "stack" for this type of
      structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top
      of each other. This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of
      the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking
      off multiple other items first.[2] Considered as a linear data structure,
      or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations
      occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the
      stack. This data structure makes it possible to implement a stack as a
      singly linked list and a pointer to the top element. A stack may be
      implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not
      contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then
      considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item
      from the top of the stack.

    <h2>How did I implement a stack in Javascript/Typescript?</h2>
    <p>
      It is relatively straight forward to implement a stack in Javascript, the
      built-in Array object has all the characteristics a stack should have and
      more. We can use Array.push() and Array.pop() to implment the two
      essential operations of a stack.
    </p>
    <code langauge="typescript" class="code-editor ts" #codeEditor></code>
    <p>
      Here we initiate a stack using JS array with value 1,2,3 and specify the
      type of its elements to be string or number.
    </p>
    <code langauge="typescript" class="code-editor ts" #codeEditor></code>
    <p>Then we create the two functions for push and pop operations.</p>
    <code langauge="html" class="code-editor html" #codeEditor></code>
    <p>
      Now we can display our stack through binding the data to html, we can use
      "ul" and "li" tags in html to display any list-like data, and then use
      angular's ngFor directive to automatically go through individual items of
      our stack to display these items,
